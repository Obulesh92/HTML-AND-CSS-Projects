                <p><b>A Child of Books and Code:</b> Musk showed an intense passion for reading and technology from a young age. At just 12 years old, he taught himself computer programming and sold the code for a video game he created, **Blastar**, for $500.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Education:</b> He emigrated to Canada at age 17 and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he earned dual bachelor's degrees in **Physics and Economics**. This dual focus laid the foundation for his future ventures, combining a deep understanding of science with business and finance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>First Successes (Zip2 & PayPal):</b> After dropping out of a Stanford Ph.D. program after only two days, he co-founded his first company, **Zip2**, an online city guide. Following its sale, he co-founded X.com in 1999, which eventually merged and became the electronic payment giant **PayPal**.
